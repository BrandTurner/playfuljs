Almost every game uses particle effects.
Whenever you see fire, smoke, explosions, fabric, water, or gunfire, it's
likely simulated with particles.
You can use this very simple concept to create impressive effects of your own:

*The humble particle*
```js
function Particle(x, y) {
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
}
```
